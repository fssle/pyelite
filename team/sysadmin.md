System Administrator
====

We are looking for another person to join our operations team. We would prefer someone in the United States who is interested in both application development and systems engineering. We are looking for someone who loves development but also loves using hardware to improve reliability and performance.

You will automate Sysadmin tasks with Chef, trouble shoot application performance issues with Newrelic, and create new tools to make things run more smoothly and efficiently. For example, if a developer has questions about the best way to improve email delivery times in an application, you will analyze the existing deployment, and use testing and metrics to deploy improvements. When you aren't working on existing projects, you might be prototyping realtime application frameworks, improving CI run times, or creating a new Campfire bot.

You will be expected to participate in an on call rotation after you are fully up to speed (traditionally 1 to 2 months). The current on call schedule is Mon-Thur or Fri-Sun, on a rotating basis. When on call, you can expect to receive a few warning alerts, help fix an occasional broken deploy, and handle some questions from the support team during the day. You can also expect to receive an alert every two to three nights.

Here are some clues you might be a good fit: You think Redis is a fantastic key value store and you want to use it in most of your projects. You've installed Pow. You know about Zeromq and Rabbitmq. You follow the Haproxy and Nginx mailing lists. You are interested in things like Goliath, zero down time migrations, and node.js.

Here is a sample of recent past and present tasks for our team:

Migrating applications to Rails 3 and bundler.
Reviewing New Relic End User Experience and Browser Mob data to improve application performance.
Working with developers to remove scalability bottlenecks such as slow database queries, requests with high GC hit rates and memory leaks.
Testing new Intel E7 processors under application and background task work loads.
Moving 100+ git repositories to Github and fixing the CI bot accordingly.
Adding new features to our automated mysql failover tool.
Sending resque queue performance data to statsd.
Building a realtime application framework using Eventmachine, Websockets, Zeromq and Redis.
Adding useful features and metrics to our operations dashboard (powered by Rails + Graphite + Statsd).
Instrumenting cron and resque jobs with New Relic.
Improving exception handling and tracking in each of the big four applications.
Configuring applications to use Amazon Cloud Front.
Creating Nagios alerts for database backup integrity checks.
Improving Solr indexing speed and reliability.
Upgrading Solr indexers to 1.4.2.
Creating new tools to be used by our Support team for troubleshooting.

Here are some cool job perks you can expect: You will have a no expense report credit card, an additional day off (each week) during the summer (currently through October), and you can work from home, or the office... it's up to you.
